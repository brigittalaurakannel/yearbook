            <h2>Construction market</h2>
            <div class="longtext">
              <p>After two years of rapid expansion the Estonian construction market began to slow in 2019. The buildings market was driven by housing construction and work procured by the public sector: mostly different buildings for educational institutions and the central and local government. The infrastructure market contracted while in road construction, which in recent years has accounted for over 90% of the infrastructure market, around a fourth of the available resource was unutilised. Despite that the sector’s employment rate is high and competition is fierce. Rapidly rising wages and materials prices as well as the growing technological complexity of new projects have increased the gap between customers’ price expectations and the actual construction price. Most new projects need to be redesigned to mitigate the rise in construction cost. This holds back wider implementation of energy efficient and green solutions, which are too costly for customers.</p>
              <div class="moretext">
                <p>
                 Low productivity has been a challenge for the construction sector for years. There is a lack of both quality and quantity. Insufficient availability of skilled labour is mitigated by using foreign labour but the shortage of qualified construction engineers is much more difficult to overcome. The sector’s attractiveness to the younger generation depends largely on its ability to modernise and improve productivity by increasing digitalisation and reducing labour intensity.
               </p>
               <p>Nordecon contributes to solving the challenges of the construction sector and improving the image of the industry by being a leader in innovation and the first implementer of innovative construction solutions.</p>

            <div class="longtext">
              <p>Our mission is to offer our customers building and infrastructure construction solutions that meet their needs and fit their budget and, thus, help them maintain and increase the value of their assets. The year 2019 was successful for Nordecon in many respects. We achieved our profitability improvement targets, secured a record number of new construction contracts, increased the share of revenue earned outside Estonia and took vigorous steps in digitalising our operations. All this was underpinned by excellent teamwork and our people’s professional expertise and skills.</p>
              <p class="moretext">
                One of the cornerstones of our strategy is a diversified portfolio – we wishes to be represented in most segments of the Estonian construction market to secure the company’s long-term and balanced growth. We analyse the construction market and our order book as well as the breakdown of projects in progress and revenue between our two segments –
Buildings and Infrastructure on a regular basis.</p>

              <p>The largest revenue source in the Buildings segment is the commercial buildings subsegment where we had several large projects in 2019, many of which will be completed in 2020. For instance, the reconstruction and extension of the building of Terminal D in the Old City Harbour and the construction of phase I of the Porto Franco commercial and office development next to the Admiralty Basin.</p>
              <p>The public buildings subsegment has also grown considerably. In 2019, our portfolio included several industrial and warehouse facilities as well as buildings for educational institutions such as the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences and Kohtla-Järve Upper Secondary School. A significant share of Nordecon’s apartment building projects in Estonia is in or near Tallinn. We also continue work on three housing development projects in Sweden.</p>

            <p>In road construction and maintenance, we contributed to building and improving several important traffic routes in Estonia. For example, in 2019 we completed the construction of passing lanes on the Pikknurme-Puurmani section of the Tallinn–Tartu–Võru–Luhamaa road and the Missoküla-Hindsa sections of main road no. 7 Riga-Pskov and began to build the Kernu bypass, the Kernu filling station and the Haiba junction. A major share of the subsegment’s revenue results from forest road improvement services provided to the State Forest Management Centre and road maintenance services delivered in Järva and Hiiu counties and the Kose maintenance area in Harju county.</p>
            <p>In the Infrastructure segment, the share of revenue generated by road construction and maintenance decreased for the first time in several years. However, this was mostly due to a few large other engineering projects, the largest of them the completion of the Kiili-Paldiski section of the onshore part of Balticconnector (a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland).</p>

            <p>In 2019, the Group’s subsidiary SweNCN AB continued to deliver services under building construction contracts secured as a general contractor. As a result, our operations in Sweden grew year on year. We continue work on three housing development projects in Stockholm area and the foundations for 73 wind turbines in the Nysäter wind farm being built in northern Sweden, near Sundsvall.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Finland</button>
          <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>In Finland, our business focus is clear: the Group’s subsidiary Nordecon Betoon OÜ and its Finnish subsidiary NOBE Rakennus OY continued to provide subcontracting services in the concrete work segment in Finland. In 2019, our business volumes in Finland grew significantly compared to previous years.</p>

          <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>In the past year, our business activity in Ukraine decreased somewhat. We continue to be conservative about projects. We enter into a contract only when it is certain that the risks involved are reasonable given the circumstances. Real estate development activities which require major investments remain suspended to minimise risks until the situation in Ukraine improves.</p>

            <h2>Quality</h2>
            <div class="longtext">
              <p>In the construction business the best result is achieved when the customer, the architect, the designer, the owner’s engineer and the builder follow the same principles and work together towards the same goal. A successful project is based on open and honest communication between all parties and the quality metrics of a construction company are well managed projects and buildings and infrastructure assets which are delivered on time and to the agreed quality standard.</p>
              <div class="moretext">
                <p>Responsibility begins from the decisions of each individual. Consistent with engineering ethics, the people of Nordecon Group always strive to come up with the best possible plan and execution to help produce more effective, efficient and sustainable solutions. Successful execution of our construction projects is based on conscious and systematic quality management.
                </p><p class="bold">
                  To ensure the compliance of work done and meet our goals, we observe in all projects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The customer’s requirements and project documentation;</li>
                  <li>Construction regulations and standards;</li>
                  <li>The Group’s management system. Our quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management systems are based on the requirements of relevant international standards (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">At the parent company, Nordecon AS, each completed building or infrastructure asset is assigned a quality coefficient which is calculated on the basis of five indicators:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>timely completion and delivery to the customer;</li>
                  <li>the number of rectification works at the planned date of completion;</li>
                  <li>customer feedback and satisfaction;</li>
                  <li>accidents and safety incidents at work;</li>
                  <li>findings of technical inspections and their resolution .</li>

              <p>Construction is one of the most accident-prone sectors, which is why it is important for everyone – the employer, the employee, the business partner and the customer that the construction site should be safe and tidy.</p>
              <p>Our responsibility is to ensure a safe working environment with properly controlled health risks for both our own employees and those of our partners.
              A safe working environment assumes the commitment of all stakeholders. Nordecon observes all applicable laws and regulations, has appointed people responsible for relevant areas and established procedures for emergency situations, conducts risk analyses, carries out health checks, and trains and informs employees. Everyone is supplied with proper work and personal protection equipment. Risk situations and accidents at work are analysed to prevent their recurrence. Each construction site has a safety plan, which helps the site team ensure all appropriate measures in cooperation with an occupational health and safety specialist.

            <div class="longtext">
              <p>Environmental aspects are becoming increasingly important in construction. This is due to both changes in regulations and public expectations as well as growing community awareness of environmental matters. Environmental developments influence construction from the design phase and we strive to ensure that our construction teams can implement new, more sustainable solutions.</p>
              <p class="bold">The most significant environmental aspects of our activities:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Materials used and waste generated in the construction process. We use materials sustainably, sort waste and where possible reuse it. Our waste sorting increased in 2019.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="moretext">
                <ul>
                  <li>The risk of polluting soil, wildlife, vegetation, water bodies and groundwater. Similarly to previous years, the companies of Nordecon group did not breach any environmental requirements in 2019.</li>
                  <li>Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from asphalt production. Although our two asphalt concrete plants operate on sustainable modern technology, they are the sources of our largest environmental impacts while also offering the biggest opportunities for energy saving.</li>

          <h2>Social impacts</h2>
          <p>Being a large construction company, Nordecon has a significant impact on local communities and society as a whole, mainly through well-planned and safe construction processes and quality end-results.</p>
          <p>We contribute to the development of society by sharing the knowledge and experience of our people and raising topics that need public discussion. We are an active partner for professional associations in the construction industry, universities and occupational qualification authorities as well as a permanent sponsor of various cooperation projects.</p>
          <p>Nordecon awards the Heinrich Laul scholarship to a lecturer or researcher up to the age of 40 that holds a doctor’s degree in engineering and works for Tallinn University of Technology. In 2019, the scholarship was awarded to Virgo Sulakatko. In addition, every autumn we give a scholarship to an outstanding student in a master’s programme in engineering. Last year, the scholarship was awarded to Kristin Raudla, a student at the Tartu College of Tallinn University of Technology. Nordecon also supports the Peep Sürje Foundation which promotes road engineering.</p>
          <p>Besides engineering, Nordecon supports education, culture and sports and the recognition of officers of the Estonian Defence Forces.</p>

          <p class="quote">The scholarship has allowed me to reduce my workload, which has enabled me to focus more on my master's thesis. My goal is to graduate with honours <span>(cum laude)</span> and I feel that the scholarship has taken me one step closer to fulfilling my dream. Also, the scholarship has increased my motivation. I am even more determined to work hard and get to the top in my field.
I think there ought to be more companies that motivate students and I fully respect Nordecon for having done this for many years.</p>

        <p>Construction is a low-productivity business across the world. Rapidly developing digital construction i.e. various digitalisation solutions help modernise the construction industry, improve its efficiency and make its image more attractive to young people choosing a profession.
